# [poly-ansible](https://gitlab.com/mavit/poly-ansible/)

Edit [YAML files for Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) containing embedded [Jinja2 templating](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/).

This is a [polymode](https://polymode.github.io/), gluing [`jinja2-mode`](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode) into [`yaml-mode`](https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode).
