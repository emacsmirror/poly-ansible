# [poly-ansible](https://gitlab.com/mavit/poly-ansible/)

Edit [YAML files for Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) containing embedded [Jinja2 templating](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/).

This is a [polymode](https://polymode.github.io/), gluing [`jinja2-mode`](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode) into either `yaml-ts-mode` or `yaml-mode`.

You will need to ensure that at least one of the following is installed:
- The [`tree-sitter-yaml`](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-yaml) Tree-sitter parser (Emacs 29 and higher only).
- The [`yaml-mode`](https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode) Emacs package.

If you have installed Emacs with your operating systemâ€™s package manager, it may have automatically installed the Tree-sitter parser for you, in which case you should be good to go.
