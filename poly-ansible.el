;;; Commentary:

;; Edit YAML files for Ansible containing embedded Jinja2 templating.
;;
;; You will need to ensure that at least one of the following is installed:
;; • The tree-sitter-yaml Tree-sitter parser (Emacs 29 and higher only).
;;   https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-yaml
;; • The yaml-mode Emacs package.
;;   https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode
;;
;; If you have installed Emacs with your operating system’s package
;; manager, it may have automatically installed the Tree-sitter parser
;; for you, in which case you should be good to go.
